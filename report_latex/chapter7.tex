\chapter{Software Testing of CCTVVS}
The aim of Software Testing is to detect defects or errors testing the
components of programs individually. During testing, the components are
combined to form a complete system. At this particular stage, testing is
concerned to demonstrate that the function meets the required functional goals,
and does not behave in abnormal ways. The test cases are chosen to assure the
system behavior can be tested for all combinations. Accordingly, the expected
behavior of the system under different combinations is given. Therefore test
cases are selected which have inputs and the outputs on expected lines, inputs
that are not valid and for which suitable messages must be given and inputs that
do not occur very frequently which can be regarded as special cases. For testing
software, various test strategies are to be used such as unit testing,
integration testing, system testing and interface testing.

In this chapter, several test cases are designed for testing the behavior of
all modules. When all modules are implemented completely, they are integrated
and deployed on Tomcat server or on Jetty Container. Test cases are executed
under same environment. Test cases mainly contain tests for functionality of
all modules. Once the application passes all the test cases it is deployed on
the production environment for actual real time use.

\section{Test Environment}
The test environment is important to get right, because a major problem faced
by most python tools are dependency issues. The Anaconda distribution of
python is used to create a virtual environment with all the packages
pre-installed. This way these environments can be easily exported to other
systems as well. In the future, the possibility of writing a dockerfile to
generate an linux image with all the existing dependencies pre-installed can be
explored. Additionally, Jupyter notebook was used for modular development and
testing as it provides an interactive way of developing and testing code.

\section{Unit Testing of Main Modules}
Unit test is the verification effort on the smallest unit of software design,
the software modules. Unit testing ensures that the bugs that occur can be
pinpointed easily since the code tested on is a small unit. The section
describes some of the unit tests run with test case details and brief
explanations.

        sub-module. It blends the color tubes present in each tube object to
        generate a summary which is then blended with a static weighted
        background generated in the previous phase. The output is a final
        summary with time-stamps on each event shown. While the module performs
        relatively well in cases of fixed camera settings but however has

\section{Integration Testing}

Integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the program
structure while at the same time conducting tests to uncover errors associated
with interfacing. The objective is to take unit tested components and build a
program structure.

    \subsection{Integration testing of tubes module}

    In order to standardize the interfaces between each module, a tube class has
    been created. Each module passes around a list of these tube objects. An
    iterative development process was adopted which added features along the
    way, by just changing a single file at a time. In this test, the possible
    errors in the interfacing between the main function and the tube
    module is being tested.

    Table \ref{table:integration-tubes} shows the integration testing of tube
    module and main module. The input is a list of video frames and the output
    is a list of tube objects which will be used in the rest of the process.

\section{System Testing}

System testing is the testing in which all modules, that are tested by
integration testing are combined to form single system. The system is tested
such that all the units are linked properly to satisfy user specific
requirement. This test helps in removing the overall bugs and improves quality
and assurance of the system. The proper functionality of the system
is concluded in system testing.

The whole system is evaluated in this system testing, with all main modules
being tested. Two system tests have been devised, as there are two main modules
which are relatively well decoupled. The system testing for the real time phase
is as shown in Table~\ref{table:system-realtime}.

    \subsection{System testing of real-time phase}

    Table \ref{table:system-realtime} shows the system testing for real-time
    phase. Here all the modules in the real-time phase are combined and tested.
    The system should automatically generate a list of updated object tubes and
    a static background video from the input video in real-time. The real-time
    phase performed successfully.

\section{Summary}

This chapter includes the general testing process, which starts with unit
testing of the main modules followed by integration testing wherein the
sub-modules and modules are merged together. System testing where the entire
system is tested for its functionality and correctness was performed. The tests
proved successful in most test cases and abnormal behavior was not traced in
any of the modules.
