Any achievement, be it scholastic or otherwise does not depend solely on the
individual efforts but on the guidance, encouragement and cooperation of
intellectuals, elders and friends. A number of personalities, in their own
capacities have helped us in carrying out this project work. We would like to
take this opportunity to thank them all. \bigskip

We deeply express my sincere gratitude to our guide
\textbf{Dr. Ramakanth Kumar P}, Professor \& Head of Department,
Department of CSE, RVCE, Bengaluru, for his able guidance, regular source
of encouragement and assistance throughout this project. We also thank him for
his valuable suggestions and expert advice. \bigskip

\justify The use of CCTVs has been on the steady rise in in the last decade,
being used for the security of public and private establishments alike.
With increasing crime rates in cities, there is a need for a smarter method
to survey the video being recorded, rather than manually going through hours
of footage, saving both time and labour. We propose a method to generate a
summary of the footage. The project also aims to simplify the task further,
by generating video summaries based on user query, thus showing exactly only
the desired type of events.

\justify The process is carried out in two phases, real-time phase and query
phase. Real-time phase works on the raw CCTV footage working to detect
motion, separate the foreground and background, extract the "tubes of
interest" and store it. YOLO object detector is then run on the these tubes
and the metadata is also stored. The query phase works on this intermediate
data. The user selects the objects (ex: car, bike etc) required in the
summary. The required events are then selected, before being rearranged by
an optimization algorithm like simulated annealing. A time-lapsed background of
the input footage is simultaneously generated along with these processes.
Finally, the rearranged tubes are blended into the background using poisson
blending to generate the summary video.

\justify Both objective and subjective parameters have been used to
evaluate the results. Objectively, the exhaustiveness (inclusion of all
events), compression factor, and overlap factor have been considered. A
compression factor of 4-5x was successfully achieved, while all significant
events were selected to achieve excellent exhaustiveness. Most trials also
successfully managed to have a very low overlap factor.
Subjectively, semantic structuring and realistic appearance of the footage
were considered. Interacting events were always shown together (thereby
maintaining semantic structuring). The blending of the tubes could
however be better leading to a more realistic video.
