\chapter{Conclusion to CCTVVS}

This project aimed to use a novel method to generate video summaries to reduce
the amount of time spent in analyzing CCTV video footage. Our implementation of
summarization by temporal rearrangement of events improves on other methods of
just detecting frames of motion. The tag-based summary selects only the required
type of event, reducing the summary length further.

A proof-of-concept has been presented, and it can be extended to be used in
commercial CCTV systems with further development.

\section{Limitations of the Project}

While the current system works well for small clips, there are limitations which
prevent it from being used in CCTV system:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimization algorithm doesn’t work very well when there are many
        events
        \item Blending algorithm doesn’t make the summary look perfectly natural
        \item Further performance improvements required for optimization phase,
        to make it run faster
    \end{itemize}

\section{Future Enhancement}

To overcome the limitations of the project, the following will be taken up in
the future:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Improve performance by parallelising and optimizing the code
        \item Experimenting and improving the optimization algorithm for better
        results with lesser overlap
        \item A simple UI for selecting the input, and setting the parameters
        for the summary is required, with links to go back to the original video
    \end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
This chapter gives an overlook of the entire video summary system and briefly
states the limitation of the project and future enhancements to grow and
overcome the limitations of the same.
